# About

I am currently a Doctoral student in the Department of Computer Science, School of Computing, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Japan. My current research focuses on social simulation, particularly agent-based modeling and simulation, to study the decision-making processes and social behaviors of individuals that might explain the link between micro and macro levels of social phenomena.

# Fields

* Social simulation
* Agent-based modeling and simulation
* Decision theory
* Bounded rationality

# Education

* 2017-2020 (expected): Dr.Eng., Computer Science, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Japan
* 2015-2017: M.Eng., Computer Science, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Japan
* 2012-2014: M.B.A., Business Administration, Bandung Institute of Technology, Indonesia
* 2003-2007: B.Comp., Computer Science, Bogor Institute of Agriculture, Indonesia
