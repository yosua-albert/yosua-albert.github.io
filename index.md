# About

I am currently a Doctoral student in the Department of Computer Science, School of Computing, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Japan. My current research focuses on social simulation, particularly agent-based modeling and simulation, to study the decision-making processes and social behaviors of individuals that might explain the link between micro and macro levels of social phenomena.
